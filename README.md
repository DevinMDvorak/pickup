# pickup

Hey guys, this is what I have for postman.

Before trying anything, go into the postman folder and run the setup.py (python setup.py in that directory)
This will give your django folders the necessary files to run postman
After setup works, you should just be able to play around with messaging

I will comment what I think needs explaining later today
